title: About me
---

I'm Iv√°n Guardado, a software developer born in Spain's small and beautiful region named Galicia, where people enjoy eating octopus, big steaks, and drinking coffee liqueur.

I love **solving business problems** applying technology solutions in a smart and scalable way. I have mastered a couple of programming languages. Still, I consider them an additional tool to get my job done, focusing on the essential problems: well-crafted code, good communication, and feedback.

I am currently focused on **FinTech backend systems**, although I've always liked contributing to different stack parts. In my [blog](/posts/), you'll find some banking infrastructure content and random stuff related to software development.

In my spare time, I enjoy practicing sports and cooking. A healthy lifestyle is my style :)
